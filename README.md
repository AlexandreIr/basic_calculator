# basic_calculator
A simple calculator that can perform tha four basic operations, has a change theme button and a copy one. Also has a padlock that doesn't
allow users to write letters on the input field that do the calculations.
# future updates 
In the future there will be a storage system that will storrage and display the preivous operantions and I will add more operations like 
square root, power and others.
